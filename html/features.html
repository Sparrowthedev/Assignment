                                        core, the less work your back needs to do.” This pose is also beneficial because
                                        it stretches the front of the hips, which can get tight after sitting for long

                            <ul>

                                    Your heart gets stronger and pumps more blood with each beat (larger stroke volume).
                                    Elite athletes, as I just mentioned, can have stroke volumes more than twice as high
                                    as average individuals. But it's not just that. Conditioned hearts also have greater
                                    diameter and mass (the heart's a muscle too and gets bigger when you train it), and
                                    they pump efficiently enough to allow for greater filling time, which is a good
                                    thing because it means that more blood fills the chambers of the heart before they
                                    pump so that more blood gets pumped with each beat.

                                </li>

                                    Downstream from the heart are your muscles, which get more efficient at consuming
                                    oxygen when you do regular aerobic exercise (remember, "consuming" oxygen means that
                                    the muscles are taking the oxygen out of the blood). This happens because of an
                                    increase in the activity and number of enzymes that transport oxygen out of the
                                    bloodstream and into the muscle. Imagine 100 oxygen molecules circulating past a
                                    muscle. You're twice as fit if the muscle can consume all 100 molecules than if it
                                    can only consume 50. Another way of saying it is that you're twice as fit as someone
                                    if your VO2 max is 60ml/kg/min. and theirs is 30ml/kg/min. In terms of performance
                                    in this scenario, you'll have more endurance because your muscles won't run out of
                                    oxygen as quickly.

                                <li class="features-p mt-3"> Mitochondria inside the muscle increase in number and
                                    activity. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells. They do all the heavy-duty
                                    work to keep you moving. They use the oxygen to burn the fat and carbohydrate that
                                    makes you go. The good news is that they increase in number and activity, by as much
                                    as 50%, in just a matter of days to weeks in response to regular aerobic exercise in
                                    adults of all ages.
